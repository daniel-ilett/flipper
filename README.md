# Flipper (WGD Spooky 2017)
A game made for the Warwick Game Design 2-week jam with the theme "Spooky (2017)". This jam ran from 5/10/17 to 19/10/17.

This game was inspired by the Crash Bash minigames, Space Bash (https://youtu.be/QSOuF1o8XOU?t=4m39s) and Pogo Painter (https://youtu.be/QSOuF1o8XOU?t=1m13s).

Developed using Unity 2017.2.0f3.

The game isn't really spooky at all. The aim is to cover as much of the ground in your colour in the time limit by stepping on tiles, while avoiding your opponents, who may place bombs to try to blow you up. You can place bombs in retaliation, of course! The match ends when 60 seconds elapse, or when all players have died.

Most important features include players comically flying out of the stadium when hit by a bomb and screenshake when a bomb goes off.
